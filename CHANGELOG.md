## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Removed the project-specific legacy `.bashrc` migration path and guide; new
  users receive only the managed loader owned by this project.
- Reframed the public problem statement around per-user, opt-in proxying on a
  shared server rather than one developer's migration history.
- Replaced the personal example port with explicit user selection and a
  read-only `--suggest-port` helper for the `20000-29999` range.
- Updated Codex prompts to recommend Plan mode and interactive collection of
  non-secret user choices.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Established direct-by-default, per-user proxy control as the public project
  model for shared servers.
- Split every maintained guide into matching `docs/en` and `docs/zh-CN` trees.
- Expanded setup to begin with a pinned, checksum-verified Mihomo installation.
- Added copyable Codex installation prompts without replacing deterministic
  installers or safety checks.

### Added

- `mihomoctl` lifecycle, status, readiness, diagnostics, logs, and version commands.
- Secure Bash functions for opt-in parent-shell and one-command proxying.
- Strict non-executing parsers for configuration and credential files.
- Idempotent installer, precise managed-loader updates, and conservative uninstaller.
- Bash completion, automated tests, secret scan, and bilingual documentation.
- CI coverage for bilingual topic completeness and relative Markdown links.
